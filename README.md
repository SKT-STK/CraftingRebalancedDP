just some minor tweaks of some recipes that i found annoying,
due to the limitations of the game's datapack crafting mechanisms, in some recipes, one of the items that shouldve come out of said recipe will be /give'n to the player after they have collected the other item from the crafting bench
currently has:
rails crafting now yields 32 instead of 16 for normal rails, and for every "non-normal" rail 16 instead of 6,
stairs crafting now yields 7 instead of 4,
signs crafting now yields 6 instead of 3 and signs now stack up to 64,
hanging signs crafting now accepts planks instead of stripped logs and hanging signs now stack up to 64,
now you can craft a full block from two corresponding slabs (chiseled variants of blocks can now be crafted by placing corresponding blocks in a 3x3 grid pattern),
now you can uncraft minecarts (eg. as in from a chest minecart to a chest and a minecart separately),
now you can get back the normal log after stripping it by crafting 4 of them in a grid (you will only get 3),
trapdoors craftings now yield 4 instead of 2,
you can now undispense your dispenser yielding you both a dropper and a randomly-damaged bow,
you can now dispenserize you droppers (combine a dropper with a bow to get a dispenser),
every recipe that accepted cobblestone now accepts all variants of cobblestone (cobblestone, cobbled_deepslate, blackstone) instead of just vanilla-chosen recipes having such behavior,
you can now unstick your pistons (same as undispensing a dispenser)
