just some minor tweaks of some recipes that i found annoying,
currently has:
rails crafting now yields 32 instead of 16 for normal rails, and for every "non-normal" rail 16 instead of 6,
stairs crafting now yields 7 instead of 4,
signs crafting now yields 6 instead of 3,
hanging signs crafting now accepts planks instead of stripped logs
