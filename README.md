just some minor tweaks of some recipes that i found annoying,
currently has:
rails crafting now yields 32 instead of 16 for normal rails, and for every "non-normal" rail 16 instead of 6,
stairs crafting now yields 7 instead of 4,
signs crafting now yields 6 instead of 3 and signs now stack up to 64,
hanging signs crafting now accepts planks instead of stripped logs and hanging signs now stack up to 64,
now you can craft a full block from two corresponding slabs (chiseled variants of blocks can now be crafted by placing corresponding blocks in a 3x3 grid pattern),
now you can uncraft minecarts (eg. as in from a chest minecart to a chest and a minecart separately) (due to limitations of the game's datapack crafting mechanisms, the minecart will be /give'n to the player after they collect the other item from the crafting bench),
now you can get back the normal log after stripping it by crafting 4 of them in a grid (you will only get 3)
